## Who  we  are

The  Shonda  Project  is  a  small  independent  charity  which  has  helped  provide  Kenyan  children  with  affordable  primary  education  for  over  20  years. 

We  believe  that  education  is  essential  in  helping  communities  move  towards  prosperity  soback  in  1993  we  helped  build  a  school  in  the  village  of  Shonda  in  Kenya  and  we  have  supported  it  ever  since.  Based  in  a  mixed  community  made  up  of  both  Christians  and  Muslims,  the  school  has  a  Christian  ethos,  and  respects  and  welcomes  all  faiths.

The  good  news  is  that  24  years  later,  the  school  is  doing  better  than  ever.  We  now  have  a  generation  of  children  educated  at  the  school  moving  into  adulthood  and  contributing  to  the  local  economy.  The  school  is  ranked  ninth  out  of  ?  in  the  local  area.  And  we  have  our  first  pupil  at  university.  click  here  to  read  Ronald’s  story

The  project  thrives  because  there  is  a  high  degree  of  trust  between  the  school,  the  trustees  based  in  the  UK,  and  the  local  community  in  Shonda.  Our  mutual  respect  and  trust  is  based  upon  good  governance  and  clear  accountability.  And  of  course  over  24  years  you  are  going  to  build  up  good,  strong  relationships.  We  are  a  partnership  and  we  believe  that  is  the  key  to  our  success.

## What  we  do

In  the  UK  we  are  a  small  group  of  volunteers  who  run  the  charity  (known  as  Shonda  UK),  working  with  the  Kenyan  Caretaker  Board  (basically  the  School  Governors),  who  have  the  day  to  day  responsibility  for  the  school.  We  are  very  clear  that  local  management  is  paramount,  and  we  work  hard  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  community  to  run  their  own  affairs.

Since  its  inception,  the  school  has  grown  in  size  with  classrooms  being  built  entirely  from  funds  raised  by  UK  donation.  Schools  are  nothing  without  teachers  and  so  the  focus  from  early  on  has  been  providing  regular  payments  to  support  teachers’  salaries.
